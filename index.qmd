abstract: |
  A paper should be about _**one** idea/problem/question_ (and how you answer it).
  
  An abstract should contain 250 words max and briefly explain:
  
  1. Motivation / teaser
  2. Short background/why topic~paper problem important
  3. Approach chosen/research method
  4. Experimental work (done or planned)
  5. Results obtained (or anticipated)
  6. Conclusion (what to do with the results)
bibliography: references.bib

# Introduction
Length ~1.5-2 pages max.

1. Nature of the problem (motivation/teaser)
2. (short) Background of previous work (or on what this paper builds)
3. Purpose and significance of the paper (why your work adds to solve the problem)
4. Method by which the problem is approached (what type of paper)
5. Contribution(s) of the paper (stop using ‘organisation of the paper, i.e. section X does x, section Y does y … tell what a reader gets from the paper)


# Background
Length: ~2 pages, 3-4 building blocks, i.e. half a page each.

- what does a reader need to know to understand the work?
- Could entail literature review and what you do with the findings from it,
  but also context stuff.


# Materials and methods
This could also be named **System model**.  
Length: ~2 pages, 3-4 building blocks, i.e. half a page each.

- Normally start with the context/system perspective or research “workflow”,
  use a diagram to explain the steps
- Describe data, source, and/or pre-processing steps
- (if required) what specific method/algorithm the paper uses/applies,
  put essential math here[^1].

[^1]: if it gets too heavy on the math-side, think about putting this in an appendix (unless you submit to a math conference)



## Results
Length: ~2 pages, 3-4 building blocks, i.e. half a page each.

- Design the paper to have about 3-4 sub-sections of results to address the
  findings and hammer home the argument/solution evidence
- Describe results and then discuss!
- Check for meaningful visualisations and use annotation to highlight what
  your text marks as finding/discussion point.  
  Make sure each figure/table is referenced (minimum once) in the text.


# Conclusions
Length: 1 page, each point minimum 1 paragraph, possibly including references.

1. What is shown by the paper and its significance
2. Limitations and advantages
3. Application of the results
4. Recommendation for future/further work
5. (Potential use/benefit for others, the world, …)


# Acknowledgment
If appropriate

# Appendices
If appropriate


# References {.unnumbered}
Make sure to turn a paper not into a journal article or thesis … 
if there are more than 15 references think about whether the paper tackles
“1” relevant problem … unless it is a literature review discussion 😉
[@knuth84] is the master.
